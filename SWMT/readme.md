# Smart Water Management Technology (SWMT)

![Prototype illustration](src/project-3.jpg)

Water is one of the most vital resources on Earth, yet its efficient management remains a global challenge due to urbanization, industrial growth, and climate change.
The Smart Water Management Technology (SWMT) project leverages IoT, Cloud Computing, and Artificial Intelligence to create a smart, automated system for monitoring and optimizing water usage.

This project demonstrates how IoT-based sensors, real-time data processing, and predictive analytics can work together to improve water efficiency, detect leaks, and support sustainable resource management.
