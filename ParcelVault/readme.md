# 📦 ParcelVault: IoT-Based Smart Delivery Box

![Prototype illustration](src/project-3.jpg)

The rapid growth of e-commerce has led to critical challenges in last-mile logistics, including package theft, missed deliveries, and environmental damage. Traditional delivery methods often leave packages unattended, making them susceptible to theft and tampering.

The ParcelVault project leverages IoT, secure authentication, and cloud synchronization to create a secure, autonomous smart delivery box that ensures packages are safely accepted even when the recipient is unavailable.

This system demonstrates how microcontroller-based hardware, real-time tracking, and a user-centric web dashboard can work together to provide a robust solution for modernizing the delivery experience.

## 📊 Overview

The ParcelVault: IoT-Based Smart Delivery Box is a complete hardware-software solution designed to:

- Offer secure, autonomous parcel acceptance and tamper-resistant storage.
- Implement a user-specific, One-Time Password (OTP)-based access control for delivery agents.
- Enable real-time tracking and status updates via a web-based dashboard.
- Use FIFO prioritization (First-In, First-Out) logic for secure handling of multiple parcels.
- Provide remote management for users to schedule deliveries and access delivery history.
