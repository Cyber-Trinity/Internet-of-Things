# Automatic Obstacle Avoidance Car

![Prototype illustration](src/project-4.jpg)

The primary aim of this project is to develop a mobile robotic platform capable of autonomous navigation in an unpredictable environment. The robot must identify obstacles and independently determine the optimal path for avoidance. 
The project achieves intelligent, self-governing movement without human intervention.
