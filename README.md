# 🤖 Internet of Things

Welcome to my **Internet of Things Portfolio**! 
<br>
This repository is a collection of my IoT-based projects, demonstrating my expertise in hardware integration, sensor data acquisition, real-time monitoring, and smart system development. Each project highlights how IoT technologies can be used to create intelligent, efficient, and sustainable solutions for real-world challenges.

## 📑 Explanation
Each project has its own folder, which may include:
  - `src/` → Contains sensor codes, microcontroller scripts, and other core project files
  - `notebooks` → Some projects include a jupyter notebooks for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning integration.
  - `requirements.txt` → List of IoT libraries and other dependencies
  - `README.md` → Short description of the project
  - `Report` → A detailed report explaining the project design, methodology, implementation, and results
  - `Dashboard` → Some projects include an interactive dashboard or IoT web interface for real-time data visualization and control
- The root `README.md` (this file) provides an overview of all the IoT projects available in this repository.
